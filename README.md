# 📊 Clinical RTF Table Generator in R

🚀 *Automating Demographic Table Creation for Clinical Trials using `r2rtf`, `tidyverse`, and Custom Formatting*

---

### 📁 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to automate the creation of **regulatory-quality RTF reports** — specifically, demographic summary tables commonly used in clinical trial submissions (e.g., Table 13.1.2: Demographics).

Built using:
- `tidyverse` for data manipulation
- `r2rtf` for generating stylized `.rtf` documents
- `dplyr`, `pivot_wider`, and `formatC` for transforming and formatting clinical data

📌 **Final Output**: A polished, landscape-format `.rtf` file ready for Word and submission.
